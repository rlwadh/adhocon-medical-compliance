or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements

## I. Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes the advances in software functionality,
the rapid pace of innovation, and their potential benefits and risks to public health. FDA is
issuing this guidance document to inform manufacturers, distributors, and other entities about
how FDA intends to apply its regulatory authorities to select software functions intended for
use on mobile platforms (mobile applications or “mobile apps”) or on general-purpose
computing platforms. Given the rapid expansion and broad applicability of software
functions deployed on mobile or other general-purpose computing platforms, FDA is issuing
this guidance document to clarify the subset of software functions to which FDA intends to
apply its authority.

FDA refers to software functions that are device functions as “device software functions.”
Device software functions may include “Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)” and
“Software in a Medical Device (SiMD).”^1 ,^2 Software functions that meet the definition of a
device may be deployed on mobile platforms, other general-purpose computing platforms, or
in the function or control of a hardware device. If a software function that meets the
definition of a device is deployed on a mobile platform, it may be referred to as a “mobile
medical app.” The policies described in this guidance are independent of the platform on
which they might run, are function-specific, and apply across platforms. Therefore, the
policies described using terms such as “mobile medical apps,” “mobile medical app
manufacturers,” “device software functions,” and “device software function manufacturers”

(^1) See the FDA website on “Software as a Medical Device (SaMD),” available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-
devices/digital-health/software-medical-device-samd.
(^2) See the International Medical Device Regulators Forum final document, “Software as a Medical Device
(SaMD): Key Definitions,” available at [http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-](http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-) 131209 -
samd-key-definitions-140901.pdf.


are not specific to whether the function is deployed on a mobile platform or other general
purpose-computing platform.

Many software functions are not medical devices (meaning such software functions do not
meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FD&C Act)), and FDA does not regulate them as devices. Some software functions may
meet the definition of a medical device, but because they pose a lower risk to the public,
FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion over these devices (meaning it does not, at
this time, intend to enforce requirements under the FD&C Act).

Consistent with FDA’s existing oversight approach that considers functionality of the
software rather than platform, FDA intends to apply its regulatory oversight to only those
software functions that are medical devices and whose functionality could pose a risk to a
patient’s safety if the device were to not function as intended.

FDA is issuing this guidance to provide clarity and predictability for software manufacturers.
This document was previously updated to be consistent with the guidance “Medical Device
Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications
Devices,” originally issued on February 9, 2015.^3 This guidance was also updated on
September 27, 2019, to be consistent with section 3060(a) of the 21st Century Cures Act
(Cures Act), which amended section 520 of the FD&C Act, removing certain software
functions from the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. The guidance was
minorly updated in accordance with the changes described in the guidance “Changes to
Existing Medical Software Policies Resulting from Section 3060 of the 21st Century Cures
Act.”^4 Examples of mobile apps and software on the FDA website^5 (that were added after
September 25, 2013) were incorporated into the appropriate appendices of this document for
consistency. This guidance also is now being minorly updated to reflect the issuance of the
final rule, “Medical Devices; Medical Device Classification Regulations To Conform to
Medical Software Provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act” (86 FR 20278)^6 and the
guidance “Clinical Decision Support Software” (referred to as CDS guidance throughout the
rest of this document)issued on September 28, 2022^7 in this latest revision.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word _should_ in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

## II. Background

As mobile platforms become more user friendly, computationally powerful, and readily
available, innovators have begun to develop mobile apps of increasing complexity to
leverage the portability mobile platforms can offer. Some of these new software functions are
specifically targeted to assist individuals in their own health and wellness management.
Other software functions are targeted to health care professionals as tools to improve and
facilitate the delivery of patient care.^11

In 1989, FDA prepared a general policy statement on how it planned to determine whether a
computer-based product and/or software-based product is a device, and, if so, how FDA
intended to regulate it. The document, “FDA Policy for the Regulation of Computer
Products,” became known as the “Draft Software Policy.” After 1989, however, the use of
computer and software products as medical devices grew exponentially and the types of
products diversified and grew more complex (and that trend has continued). As a result, FDA
determined that the draft policy did not adequately address all of the issues related to the
regulation of all medical devices containing software. Therefore, in 2005, the Draft Software
Policy was withdrawn.^12

Although FDA has not issued an overarching software policy, the Agency has formally
classified certain types of software applications that meet the definition of a device and,
through classification, identified specific regulatory requirements that apply to these devices
and their manufacturers. These software devices include products that feature one or more
software components, parts, or accessories, as well as devices that are composed solely of
software.

development-and-use-standards-regulatory-submissions-reviewed-center-biologics-evaluation.
(^11) For the purposes of this guidance, FDA uses the term health care professional to mean an individual who is
licensed, registered, or certified by a State, territory, or other governing body, to administer health care,
including but not limited to, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, clinical social worker,
dentist, occupational therapist, pharmacist, physical therapist, physician, physician assistant, psychologist,
respiratory therapist, speech-la nguage pathologist, technologist, or any other practitioner or allied health
professional.

comprehensive-list-of -guidance-documents-at-the-food-and-drug-administration.


FDA has previously clarified that when a software application is used to analyze medical
device data, it has traditionally been regulated as an accessory to a medical device^13 or as
medical device software. In 2014, the International Medical Device Regulators Forum
established globally harmonized vocabulary for such software applications and defined the
term “Software as a Medical Device (SaMD).”^14

As is the case with traditional medical devices, certain software functions that are device
functions (referred to in this document as “device software functions”) can pose potential
risks to public health. Moreover, certain device software functions may pose risks that are
unique to the characteristics of the platform on which the software function is run. For
example, the interpretation of radiological images on a mobile device could be adversely
affected by the smaller screen size, lower contrast ratio, and uncontrolled ambient light of the
mobile platform. FDA intends to take these risks into account in assessing the appropriate
regulatory oversight for these products.

Additionally, the Cures Act, enacted on December 13, 2016, amended section 520 of the
FD&C Act to remove certain software functions from the definition of device (201(h) of the
FD&C Act). FDA has published the following guidance documents that help provide clarity
on the types of software functions that do not meet the definition of device:

```
· Changes to Existing Medical Software Policies Resulting from Section 3060
of the 21st Century Cures Act^15
· Clinical Decision Support Software^16
· Medical Device Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical
Image Communications Devices^17
· General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices^18
```
This guidance clarifies and outlines FDA’s current thinking. The Agency will continue to
evaluate the potential impact these technologies might have on improving health care,
reducing potential medical mistakes, and protecting patients.

## III. Definitions...........................................................................................................................

## A. Mobile Platform

For purposes of this guidance, “mobile platforms” are defined as commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) computing platforms, with or without wireless connectivity, that are handheld in
nature. Examples of these mobile platforms include mobile computers such as smart phones,
tablet computers, or other portable computers.

## B. Mobile Application (Mobile App)

For purposes of this guidance, a mobile application or “mobile app” is defined as a software
application that can be executed (run) on a mobile platform (i.e., a handheld commercial off-
the-shelf computing platform, with or without wireless connectivity), or a web-based
software application that is tailored to a mobile platform but is executed on a server.

## C. Mobile Medical Application (Mobile Medical 

## App)

For purposes of this guidance, a “mobile medical app” is a mobile app that incorporates
device software functionality that meets the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the
FD&C Act;^19 and either is intended:

```
· to be used as an accessory to a regulated medical device; or
· to transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device.
```
(^19) Products that are built with or consist of computer and/or software components or applications are subject to
regulation as devices when they meet the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. That
provision defines a device as “...an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro
reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory”, that is “... intended for
use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,
in man ...” or “... intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals...” and
“does not include software functions excluded pursuant to section 520(o)” of the FD&C Act. Thus, software
applications that run on a desktop computer, laptop computer, remotely on a website or “cloud,” or on a
handheld computer may be subject to device regulation if they are intended for use in the diagnosis or the cure,
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man. The
level of regulatory control necessary to assure safety and effectiveness varies based upon the risk the device
presents to public health. See Appendix C for examples.


The intended use of a mobile app determines whether it meets the definition of a “device.”
As stated in 21 CFR 801.4,^20 intended use may be shown by labeling^21 claims, advertising
materials, or oral or written statements by manufacturers or their representatives. When the
intended use of a mobile app is for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or the cure,
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any
function of the body of man, the mobile app is a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C
Act if it is not a software function excluded from the device definition by section 520(o) of
the FD&C Act.

One example is a mobile app that makes a light emitting diode (LED) operate. If the
manufacturer intends the system to illuminate objects generally (i.e., without a specific
medical device intended use), the mobile app would not be considered a medical device. If,
however, through marketing, labeling, and the circumstances surrounding the distribution,
the mobile app is promoted by the manufacturer for use as a light source for doctors to
examine patients, then the intended use of the light source would be similar to a conventional
device such as an ophthalmoscope.

In general, if a software function is intended for use in performing a medical device function
(i.e., for diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or the cure, mitigation, treatment, or
prevention of disease), it is a medical device, regardless of the platform on which it is run.
For example, mobile apps intended to run on smart phones to analyze and interpret EKG
waveforms to detect heart function irregularities would be considered similar to software
running on a desktop computer that serves the same function, which is regulated under 21
CFR 870.2340 (“Electrocardiograph”). FDA’s oversight approach to software functions is
focused on their functionality, just as we focus on the functionality of conventional devices.
Our oversight is not determined by the platform. Under this guidance, FDA would **not**
regulate the sale or general/conventional consumer use of smartphones or tablets. FDA’s
oversight applies to software functions performing medical device functions, such as when a
mobile medical app or software application transforms a mobile platform or a general
purpose computing platform into a medical device. However, as previously noted, we intend
to apply this oversight authority only to those software applications whose functionality

(^20) “The words ‘intended uses’ or words of similar import ... refer to the objective intent of the persons legally
responsible for the labeling of devices. The intent is determined by such persons' expressions or may be shown
by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the article. This objective intent may, for example, be
shown by labeling claims, advertising matter, or oral or written statements by such persons or their
representatives. It may be shown by the circumstances that the article is, with the knowledge of such persons or
their representatives, offered and used for a purpose for which it is neither labeled nor advertised. The intended
uses of an article may change after it has been introduced into interstate commerce by its manufacturer. If, for
example, a packer, distributor, or seller intends an article for different uses than those intended by the person
from whom he received the devices, such packer, distributor, or seller is required to supply adequate labeling in
accordance with the new intended uses. But if a manufacturer knows, or has knowledge of facts that would give
him notice that a device introduced into interstate commerce by him is to be used for conditions, purposes, or
uses other than the ones for which he offers it, he is required to provide adequate labeling for such a device
which accords with such other uses to which the article is to be put.” 21 CFR 801.4.
(^21) “The term ‘labeling’ means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any
of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.” Section 201(m) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C.
321(m).


could pose a risk to a patient’s safety if the software applications were to not function as
intended.

## D. Regulated Medical Device

For purposes of this guidance, a “regulated medical device” is defined as a product that meets
the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act and that has been cleared or
approved by FDA’s review of a premarket submission or otherwise classified by FDA.

This definition can include novel devices, whether or not on a mobile platform, that FDA
will clear or approve by the review of a premarket submission or otherwise classify.
Examples of regulated medical devices are identified in Appendix C.

## E. Mobile Medical App Manufacturer

For purposes of this guidance, a “mobile medical app manufacturer” is any person or entity
that manufactures mobile medical apps in accordance with the definitions of manufacturer in
21 CFR Parts 803, 806, 807, and 820.^22 A mobile medical app manufacturer may include
anyone who initiates specifications, designs, labels, or creates a software system or
application for a regulated medical device in whole or from multiple software components.
This term does not include persons who exclusively distribute mobile medical apps without
engaging in manufacturing functions; examples of such distributors may include owners and
operators of mobile application stores (“app stores”). Examples of mobile medical app
manufacturers include any person or entity that:

```
· Creates, designs, develops, labels, re-labels, remanufactures, modifies, or creates a
mobile medical app software system from multiple components. This could include a
person or entity that creates a mobile medical app by COTS software components and
markets the product to perform as a mobile medical app;
```
```
· Initiates specifications or requirements for mobile medical apps or procures product
development/manufacturing services from other individuals or entities (second party)
for subsequent commercial distribution. For example, when a “developer” (i.e., an
entity that provides engineering, design, and development services) creates a mobile
medical app from the specifications that were initiated by the “author,” the “author”
who initiated and developed specifications for the mobile medical app is considered a
```
(^22) Regulatory definitions of the term “manufacturer” or “manufacture” appear in 21 CFR Parts 803, 806, 807,
and 820. For example – under FDA’s 21 CFR 807.3(d) – establishment registration and device listing for
manufacturers and initial importers of devices – “Manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding,
assembly, or processing of a device means the making by chemical, physical, biological, or other procedures of
any article that meets the definition of device in section 201(h) of the act. These terms include the following
activities: (1) Repackaging or otherwise changing the container, wrapper, or labeling of any device package in
furtherance of the distribution of the device from the original place of manufacture to the person who makes
final delivery or sale to the ultimate consumer; (2) Initial importation of devices manufactured in foreign
establishments; or (3) Initiation of specifications for devices that are manufactured by a second party for
subsequent commercial distribution by the person initiating specifications.”


```
“manufacturer” of the mobile medical app under 21 CFR 803.3. For purposes of this
guidance, manufacturers of a mobile medical app would include persons or entities
who are the creators of the original idea (initial specifications) for a mobile medical
app, unless another entity assumes all responsibility for manufacturing and
distributing the mobile medical app, in which case that other entity would be the
“manufacturer.”^23 Software “developers” of a mobile medical app that are only
responsible for performing design and development activities to transform the
author’s specifications into a mobile medical app would not constitute manufacturers,
and instead the author would be considered the manufacturer;
```
```
· Creates a mobile medical app and hardware attachments for a mobile platform that
are intended to be used as a medical device by any combination of the mobile medical
app, hardware attachments, and the mobile platform;
```
```
· Creates a mobile medical app or a software system that provides users access to the
medical device function through a website subscription, software as a service,^24 or
other similar means.
```
In contrast, the following are examples of persons or entities that are NOT considered to be
mobile medical app manufacturers (i.e., persons _not_ within the definition of manufacturer in
21 CFR Parts 803, 806, 807, and 820). Because they are not manufacturers, none of the
persons or entities in these examples would have to register their establishments, list their
products with FDA,^25 or submit a premarket application:

```
· Manufacturers or distributors of mobile platforms who solely distribute or market
their platform and do not intend (by marketing claims – e.g., labeling claims or
advertising material) the platform to be used for medical device functions. When
mobile medical apps are run on a mobile platform, the mobile platform is treated as a
component of the mobile medical app’s intended use.^26 Therefore the mobile platform
manufacturer is exempt from the Quality System regulation and registration and
listing requirements.^27 For example, if it is possible to run mobile medical apps on
BrandNamePhone but BrandNamePhone is not marketed by BrandNameCompany as
intended for use as a medical device, then BrandNameCompany would not be
considered a mobile medical app manufacturer or a medical device manufacturer.
Also, in this example, the BrandNamePhone sold to consumers would not be
regulated by FDA as a medical device. FDA does not consider entities that
exclusively distribute mobile medical apps, such as the owners and operators of app
stores to be medical device manufacturers based on their ownership of or operation of
```
(^23) See 21 CFR 803.3 (definition of manufacturer) and 21 CFR 807.20(a)(2).
(^24) By this we mean to include any “server software application” that provides a service to a client software
application on a mobile platform.
(^25) See 21 CFR 807.65 and 21 CFR 807.85.
(^26) See 21 CFR 820.3(c), which defines a component as “any raw material, substance, piece, part, software,
firmware, labeling, or assembly which is intended to be included as part of the finished, packaged, and labeled
device.”
(^27) See 21 CFR 807.65(a) and 21 CFR 820.1(a).


```
these app stores. FDA also does not consider mobile platform manufacturers to be
medical device manufacturers just because their mobile platforms could be used to
run a mobile medical app regulated by FDA.
```
```
· Third parties who solely provide market access to mobile medical apps (i.e., solely
distribute mobile apps), but do not engage in any manufacturing functions as defined
in 21 CFR Parts 803, 806, 807, and 820. Examples of such third parties may include
owners and operators that are only engaged in providing an app store that allows
mobile medical app manufacturers to commercially distribute their mobile medical
apps.
```
```
· Providers of tools, services, or infrastructure used in the development, distribution, or
use of a mobile medical app. Examples include providers of internet connectivity
(i.e., internet service), providers of general-purpose computer or information
technology, or providers that host the web service for content or software application.
Other examples of providers of tools, services, or infrastructure include customer
support services, data center hosting services, cloud hosting services, application
hosting services, wireless carriers, or providers of software development kits.
However, a creator of a mobile medical app or a software system that provides users
access to the medical device function through a website subscription, software as a
service,^28 or other similar means is considered a mobile medical app manufacturer.
```
```
· Licensed practitioners, including physicians, dentists, and optometrists, who
manufacture a mobile medical app or alter a mobile medical app solely for use in
their professional practice and do not label or promote their mobile medical apps to
be generally used by other licensed practitioners or other individuals.^29 ,^30 For
example, if Dr. XYZ, a licensed practitioner, creates a mobile medical app called the
“XYZ-recorder” that enables attaching an ECG electrode to a smartphone, and
provides the “XYZ-recorder” to his/her patient to use it to record the patient’s
electrocardiographic readings for 24 hours, Dr. XYZ is not considered a mobile
medical app manufacturer. If Dr. XYZ is in a group practice (including a telehealth
network) and permits other physicians in the practice to provide the XYZ-recorder to
their patients, Dr. XYZ is not considered a mobile medical apps manufacturer.
However, if Dr. XYZ, the licensed practitioner, distributes the “XYZ-recorder” and,
through labeling or promotion intends to make it generally available to or to be
generally used by other physicians (or other specially qualified persons), Dr. XYZ
would be considered a mobile medical app manufacturer.
```
(^28) As identified in footnote 29 , we mean to include any “server software application” that provides a service to a
client software application on a mobile platform.
(^29) Section 510(g)(2) of the FD&C Act: – Registration of producers of drugs or devices – Exclusions from
application of section: “practitioners licensed by law to prescribe or administer drugs or devices and who
manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or process drugs or devices solely for use in the course of their
professional practice.”
(^30) See 21 CFR 807.65(d).


```
· Persons who manufacture mobile medical apps solely for use in research, teaching, or
analysis and do not introduce such devices into commercial distribution. We note that
while persons conducting research using mobile medical apps involving human
subjects are exempt from registration and listing, they may instead be subject to
investigational device exemption regulations.^31 ,^32
```
## IV. Scope

This guidance explains FDA’s intentions to focus its oversight on a subset of software
functions. Mobile medical apps, as defined in Section III, include only those mobile apps that
meet the definition of a device and either are intended:

```
· to be used as an accessory to a regulated medical device; or
· to transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device.
```
Appendix A provides examples of software functions, that do **NOT** meet the definition of a
device and, therefore, are NOT device software functions or mobile medical apps for the
purposes of this guidance.

Section V.B and Appendix B provide examples of software functions, some of which are
mobile apps, that MAY meet the definition of a device but for which FDA intends to exercise
enforcement discretion because they pose a low risk to patients.

FDA’s policies regarding accessories to medical devices are not unique to device software
functions and go beyond the scope of this guidance. Specifically this guidance does not
address FDA’s general approach for accessories to medical devices which is described in the
guidance “Medical Device Accessories - Describing Accessories and Classification
Pathways”.^33

Additionally, FDA’s approach to software that performs patient-specific analysis to aid or
support clinical decision-making, is described in a separate guidance titled “Clinical Decision
Support Software”.^34

If you are developing a software function that meets the definition of a device (such as a
mobile medical app) with an entirely new intended use, we encourage you to contact FDA to
discuss what regulatory requirements may apply.

## V. Regulatory Approach for Device Software Functions

accessories-describing-accessories-and-classification-pathways.
(^34) Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-
support-software


As described in this guidance, FDA intends to apply its regulatory oversight to only those
software functions that are medical devices and whose functionality could pose a risk to a
patient’s safety if the device were to not function as intended. This approach to overseeing
device software functions is consistent with our existing approach to overseeing medical
device functionality of a product and the risks it poses to patients regardless of the shape,
size, or the platform. FDA believes that this subset of device software functions poses the
same or similar potential risks to the public health as currently regulated devices if they fail
to function as intended.

FDA strongly recommends that manufacturers of all software functions that may meet the
definition of a device follow the Quality System^35 regulation (that includes good
manufacturing practices) in the design and development of their device software functions,
and initiate prompt corrections to their devices, when appropriate, to prevent patient and user
harm.

For device software functions, manufacturers must meet the requirements associated with the
applicable device classification. If the device, on its own, falls within a medical device
classification, its manufacturer is subject to the requirements associated with that
classification. A device software function, like other devices, may be classified as class I
(general controls), class II (special controls in addition to general controls), or class III
(premarket approval).^36

## A. Device software functions: Subset of software 

## functions that are the focus of FDA’s regulatory 

## oversight

Software functions may take a number of forms, but it is important to note that FDA intends
to apply its regulatory oversight to only the subset of software functions identified below and
in Appendix C. These software functions can transform a general-purpose computing
platform or mobile platform into a regulated medical device by using attachments, display
screens, sensors, or other such methods. Regardless of the mechanism behind the
transformation, FDA considers such software to be device software functions.

The following are software functions that FDA considers to be device software functions
subject to regulatory oversight:

**1. Software functions that are an extension of one or more medical devices by**
    **connecting**^37 **to such device(s) for purposes of controlling**^38 **the device(s) or**
    **analyzing medical device data.**

(^35) See 21 CFR Part 820.
(^36) See “Device Advice: Classify Your Medical Device” at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-
device-regulation/classify-your-medical-device.
(^37) To meet this criterion, the device software functions or mobile medical apps need not be physically connected
to the regulated medical device (i.e., the connection can be wired or wireless).
(^38) Controlling the intended use, function, modes, or energy source of the connected medical device.


```
o Examples of these types of software functions include : software that provides
the ability to control inflation and deflation of a blood pressure cuff through a
mobile platform and mobile apps that control the delivery of insulin on an
insulin pump by transmitting control signals to the pumps from the mobile
platform.
```
```
In some cases, software that meets the definition of a device may be used in
combination with other devices. In these cases, the device software function
may be considered an accessory if it supports, supplements, and/or augments
the performance of one or more parent devices. FDA’s “Medical Device
Accessories - Describing Accessories and Classification Pathways”^39
guidance document should be referenced for information pertaining to the
regulation of accessories to medical devices.
```
**2. Software functions (typically, mobile apps) that transform the mobile platform**
    **into a regulated medical device by using attachments, display screens, or sensors**
    **or by including functionalities similar to those of currently regulated medical**
    **devices. Software functions that use attachments, display screens, sensors, or**
    **other such similar components to transform a mobile platform into a regulated**
    **medical device are required to comply with the device classification associated**
    **with the transformed platform.**

```
o Examples of these types of software functions include: a software function that
uses a mobile platform for medical device functions, such as attachment of a
blood glucose strip reader to a mobile platform to function as a glucose meter;
or attachment of electrocardiograph (ECG) electrodes to a mobile platform to
measure, store, and display ECG signals; a software function that uses the
built-in accelerometer on a mobile platform to collect motion information for
monitoring sleep apnea; a software function that uses sensors (internal or
external) on a mobile platform for creating electronic stethoscope function is
considered to transform the mobile platform into an electronic stethoscope;
manufacturers of such a mobile app are required to follow the requirements of
21 CFR 870.1875(b) (Electronic stethoscope); and similarly, a software
function that displays radiological images for diagnosis transforms the mobile
platform into a Medical image management and processing system under 21
CFR 892.2050.
```
```
FDA has cleared several mobile medical apps with attachments to a mobile
platform. Specifically, patient monitoring mobile apps that monitor a patient
for heart rate variability from a signal produced by an electrocardiograph,
vectorcardiograph, or blood pressure monitor are classified as cardiac
monitoring software under 21 CFR 870.2300 (Cardiac monitor (including
```
(^39) https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-accessories-
describing-accessories-and-classification-pathways


```
cardiotachometer and rate alarm)). Other mobile medical apps that use a
hardware attachment or interface to a monitoring system that have been
cleared include an automatic electronic blood pressure monitor under 21 CFR
870.1130 and a perinatal monitoring system under 21 CFR 884.2740.
```
**3. Software functions that become a regulated medical device by performing**
    **patient-specific analysis and providing specific output(s) or directive(s) to health**
    **care professionals for use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, cure, or**
    **prevention of a disease or condition. Additionally, software functions that**
    **perform patient-specific analysis and provide patient-specific diagnosis or**
    **treatment recommendations to patients, caregivers, or other users who are not**
    **health care professionals.**

```
o Examples of these types of software functions include: software functions that
use patient-specific parameters and calculate dosage or create a dosage plan
for radiation therapy; Computer Aided Detection software (CAD) image
processing software;^40 and radiation therapy treatment planning software;^41
software function that analyzes patient-specific medical information to detect
a life-threatening and/or time critical condition, such as stroke or sepsis, and
generate an alarm or an alert to notify a health care professional;^42 software
function that analyzes readings from a blood glucose monitor and alerts the
user of readings outside a predetermined range; software function that
analyzes an ECG waveform output from an FDA-cleared device to detect or
diagnose arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation).^43 We believe that these types of
software present the same level of risk to patients regardless of the platform
on which they run.
```
FDA encourages manufacturers of such device software functions that perform patient-
specific analysis to contact FDA to discuss what, if any, regulatory requirements may apply.
For additional examples see Appendix C.

## B. Software functions for which FDA intends to 

## exercise enforcement discretion (meaning that 

## FDA does not intend to enforce requirements 

## under the FD&C Act)

In general, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for software functions that:

**1.** Help patients (i.e., users) self-manage their disease or conditions without providing
    specific treatment or treatment suggestions; or

(^40) 21 CFR 892.2050.
(^41) 21 CFR 892.2050.
(^42) Similar to Example 12 in Section V.C “Examples of Device Software Functions” of the CDS Guidance
(^43) Similar to Example 20 in Section V.C “Examples of Device Software Functions” of the CDS Guidance


**2.** Automate simple tasks for health care professionals.

Some software functions in the above categories and listed below may be considered device
software functions, and others might not. For these examples listed below that are devices,
FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion because they pose a low risk to patients.

The following examples represent software functions for which FDA intends to exercise
enforcement discretion:

**1. Software functions that provide or facilitate supplemental clinical care, by**
    **coaching or prompting, to help patients manage their health in their daily**
    **environment** – These are software functions that supplement^44 professional clinical
    care by facilitating behavioral change or coaching patients with specific diseases or
    identifiable health conditions in their daily environment. Examples include:

```
o Software functions that coach patients with conditions such as cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, and promote strategies for
maintaining a healthy weight, getting optimal nutrition, exercising and staying
fit, managing salt intake, or adhering to pre-determined medication dosing
schedules^45 by simple prompting.
```
**2. Software functions that are specifically marketed to help patients communicate**
    **with health care professionals by supplementing or augmenting the data or**
    **information by capturing an image for patients to convey to their health care**
    **professionals about potential medical conditions** – These products either pose little
    or no risk, or are the sole responsibility of the health care professionals who have
    experience with them in medical applications. Examples include:

```
o Apps specifically intended for medical uses that utilize the mobile device’s
built-in camera or a connected camera for purposes of documenting or
transmitting pictures (e.g., photos of a patient’s skin lesions or wounds) to
supplement or augment what would otherwise be a verbal description in a
consultation between health care professionals or between health care
professionals and patients/caregivers.
```
**3. Software functions that perform simple calculations routinely used in clinical**
    **practice** – These are software functions that are intended to provide a convenient way
    for clinicians to perform various simple medical calculations taught in medical

(^44) By this we mean that the software function can be safely used by a patient without active oversight by a
medical professional and, when used for serious conditions necessitating professional medical care, use of the
software function is not intended to replace or discourage seeking treatment from a health care professional.
(^45) We consider these device software functions to be “medication reminders – Product code NXQ” currently
defined as “A medication reminder is a device intended for medical purposes to provide alerts to patients or
health care providers for pre-determined medication dosing schedules. The device may incorporate wireless
communication.” FDA intends to not enforce applicable regulatory requirements for this specific product code
(NXQ) identified under 21 CFR 890.5050 – Daily activity assist device.


```
schools^46 and are routinely used in clinical practice. This software is generally
tailored for clinical use, but retains functionality that is similar to simple general-
purpose tools such as paper charts, spread sheets, timers, or generic mathematical
calculators. Examples of such general-purpose tools include medical calculators for:
```
```
o Body Mass Index (BMI);
o Total Body Water / Urea Volume of Distribution;
o Mean arterial pressure;
o Glasgow Coma Scale score;
o APGAR score;
o NIH Stroke Scale; or
o Delivery date estimator.
```
See Appendix B for additional examples of software functions for which FDA intends to
exercise enforcement discretion.

## VI. Regulatory Requirements

This guidance is intended to assist manufacturers in determining if a software function meets
the definition of a device. Additional information can be found in “Device Advice: Classify
Your Medical Device.”^47 This section describes in greater detail the regulatory requirements
applicable to device software functions under this guidance (as described in Section V).

Manufacturers of device software functions are subject to the requirements described in the
applicable device classification regulation below. Depending on the classification and the
associated regulation for the device software function, manufacturers are required to follow
associated controls established by the regulation.

In general, the associated controls for each class of device are outlined below.

Class I devices: General Controls, including:

```
· Establishment registration, and Medical Device listing (21 CFR Part 807);
· Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820);
· Labeling Requirements (21 CFR Part 801);
· Medical Device Reporting (21 CFR Part 803);
· Premarket Notification (21 CFR Part 807);
· Reporting Corrections and Removals (21 CFR Part 806); and
· Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) requirements for clinical studies of
investigational devices (21 CFR Part 812).
```
(^46) The types of information in these calculators are available in medical sources, which includes medical
textbooks used in the curriculum of accredited medical schools.
(^47) Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/classify-your-medical-device.


Class II devices: General Controls (as described for Class I), Special Controls, and (for most
Class II devices) Premarket Notification.

Class III devices: General Controls (as described for Class I), and Premarket Approval (
CFR Part 814).

Appendix D provides a brief summary of the above requirements. Additional information is

## Appendix A  Examples of Software Functions that are 

## NOT Medical Devices

This Appendix provides a representative list of software functions to illustrate the types of
software that could be used in a health care environment, in clinical care, or patient
management, but are not considered medical devices. Because these software functions are
not considered medical devices, FDA does not regulate them. FDA understands that there
may be other unique and innovative software functions that may not be covered in this list
that may also constitute health care related software. **This list is not exhaustive** ; it is only
intended to provide clarity and assistance in identifying when a software function is not
considered to be a medical device.

Specific examples of software functions that FDA does not consider to be devices and with
no regulatory requirements under the current laws administered by FDA include:

1. **Software functions that are intended to provide access to electronic “copies”**
    **(e.g., e-books, audio books) of medical textbooks or other reference materials**
    **with generic text search capabilities** – These are not devices because the software is
    intended to be used as reference material and is not intended for use in the diagnosis
    of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
    disease by facilitating a health professional’s assessment of a specific patient,
    replacing the judgment of clinical personnel, or performing any clinical assessment.
    Examples of these types of software functions include:

```
o Medical dictionaries;
o Electronic copies of medical textbooks or literature articles such as the
Physician’s Desk Reference or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM);
o Library of clinical descriptions for diseases and conditions;
o Encyclopedia of first-aid or emergency care information;
o Medical abbreviations and definitions; and
o Translations of medical terms across multiple languages.
```
2. **Software functions that are intended for health care professionals to use as**
    **educational tools for medical training or to reinforce training previously**
    **received** – These may have more functionality than providing an electronic copy of
    text (e.g., videos, interactive diagrams), but are not devices because they are intended
    generally for user education and are not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or
    other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease by
    facilitating a health professional’s assessment of a specific patient, replacing the
    judgment of clinical personnel, or performing any clinical assessment. Examples of
    these types of software functions include:

```
o Medical flash cards with medical images, pictures, graphs, etc.;
o Question/Answer quiz apps;
```

```
o Interactive anatomy diagrams or videos;
o Surgical training videos;
o Medical board certification or recertification preparation apps; and
o Games that simulate various cardiac arrest scenarios to train health
professionals in advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills.
```
3. **Software functions that are intended for general patient education and facilitate**
    **patient access to commonly used reference information** – This software can be
    patient-specific (i.e., filters information to patient-specific characteristics), but is
    intended for increased patient awareness, education, and empowerment, and
    ultimately supports patient-centered health care. These functions are not devices
    because they are intended generally for patient education, and are not intended for use
    in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or
    prevention of disease by aiding clinical decision-making (i.e., to facilitate a health
    professional’s assessment of a specific patient, replace the judgment of a health
    professional, or perform any clinical assessment). Examples include software
    functions that:

```
o Provide a portal for health care professionals to distribute educational
information (e.g., interactive diagrams, useful links, and resources) to their
patients regarding their disease, condition, treatment, or upcoming procedure;
o Help guide patients to ask appropriate questions to their physician relevant to
their particular disease, condition, or concern;
o Provide information about gluten-free food products or restaurants;
o Help match patients with potentially appropriate clinical trials and facilitate
communication between the patient and clinical trial investigators;
o Provide tutorials or training videos on how to administer first-aid or CPR;
o Allow users to input pill shape, color, or imprint, and displays pictures and
names of pills that match this description;
o Find the closest medical facilities and doctors to the user’s location;
o Provide lists of emergency hotlines and physician/nurse advice lines; and
o Provide and compare costs of drugs and medical products at pharmacies in the
user’s location.
```
4. **Software functions that automate general office operations in a health care**
    **setting** and are not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or
    in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples include
    software functions that:

```
o Determine billing codes like ICD-9 (international statistical classification of
diseases);
o Enable insurance claims data collection and processing and other apps that are
similarly administrative in nature;
o Analyze insurance claims for fraud or abuse;
o Perform medical business accounting functions or track and trend billable
hours and procedures;
```

```
o Generate reminders for scheduled medical appointments or blood donation
appointments;
o Help patients track, review, and pay medical claims and bills online;
o Manage shifts for doctors;
o Manage or schedule hospital rooms or bed spaces;
o Provide wait times and electronic check-in for hospital emergency rooms and
urgent care facilities;
o Allow health care professionals or staff in health care settings to process
payments (for example, using a HIPAA compliant app to process payments);
and
o Track or perform patient satisfaction survey after an encounter or a clinical
visit.
```
5. **Software functions that are generic aids or general-purpose products** – This
    software is not considered a device because it is not intended for use in the diagnosis
    of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
    disease. Examples include software functions that:

```
o Use the mobile platform as a magnifying glass (but are not specifically
intended for medical purposes);^50
o Use the mobile platform for recording audio, note-taking, replaying audio
with amplification, or other similar functionalities;
o Allow patients or health care professionals to interact through email, web-
based platforms, video, or other communication mechanisms (but are not
specifically intended for medical purposes);
o Provide maps and turn-by-turn directions to medical facilities; and
o Allow health care professionals to communicate in a secure and protected
method (for example using a HIPAA compliant app to send messages between
health care professionals in a hospital).
```
6. **Software functions that are intended for individuals to log, record, track,**
    **evaluate, or make decisions or behavioral suggestions related to developing or**
    **maintaining general fitness, health or wellness** , such as those that:

```
o Provide tools to promote or encourage healthy eating, exercise, weight loss, or
other activities generally related to a healthy lifestyle or wellness;
o Provide dietary logs, calorie counters, or make dietary suggestions;
o Provide meal planners and recipes;
o Track general daily activities or make exercise or posture suggestions;
o Track a normal baby’s sleeping and feeding habits;
o Actively monitor and trend exercise activity;
```
(^50) Medical purpose magnifiers are regulated either under 21 CFR 886.5840 – Magnifying spectacles (“devices
that consist of spectacle frames with convex lenses intended to be worn by a patient who has impaired vision to
enlarge images”), or under 21 CFR 886.5540 – Low-vision magnifiers (“a device that consists of a magnifying
lens intended for use by a patient who has impaired vision. The device may be held in the hand or attached to
spectacles”).


```
o Help healthy people track the quantity or quality of their normal sleep
patterns;
o Provide and track scores from mind-challenging games or generic “brain age”
tests;
o Provide daily motivational tips (e.g., via text or other types of messaging) to
reduce stress and promote a positive mental outlook;
o Use social gaming to encourage healthy lifestyle habits; and
o Calculate calories burned in a workout.
```
7. **Software functions that enable individuals to interact with electronic health**
    **record (EHR) software certified under the ONC Health IT Certification**
    **Program** – These are software functions that provide individuals with access to
    health record systems or enable them to gain electronic access to health information
    stored within an EHR system. Software functions that only allow individuals to view,
    transfer, or download EHR data are also included in this category. These software
    functions are generally meant to facilitate general patient health information
    management and health recordkeeping activities:

```
o Software functions for health care professionals certified under the ONC
Health IT Certification Program, such as those that help track or manage
patient immunizations by documenting the need for immunization, consent
form, and immunization lot number.
o Software functions certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program
that prompt the health care professional to manually enter symptomatic,
behavioral, or environmental information, the specifics of which are pre-
defined by a health care professional, and store the information for later
review.
```
8. Software functions that enable patients or health care professionals to interact with
    EHR systems (e.g., transfer, store, convert formats, display electronic patient records)
    that are certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program, or interact with
    personal health record (PHR) systems.
9. Software functions that allow a user to record (i.e., collect and log) data, such as
    blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, or other data from a device to
    eventually share with a heath care professional, or upload it to an EHR that is
    certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program, or upload it to an online
    (cloud) database, or upload it to a PHR.
10. Software functions that provide a list of appropriate cholesterol-lowering drugs to a
    health care professional to consider based on a patient’s cholesterol levels and
    demographics found in the EHR, and the basis for the recommendations is provided


```
to the health care professional, so the health care professional does not rely primarily
on the recommendations in making a clinical decision about a patient.^51
```
11. **Software functions that provide health care professionals easy access to**
    **information related to patients’ health conditions or treatments (beyond**
    **providing an electronic “copy” of a medical reference), and enable the health**
    **care professional to independently review the basis of the information provided**
    **by the software function, such that the health care professional does not rely**
    **primarily on the information to make a clinical decision about an individual**
    **patient:**^52

```
o These software functions match patient-specific medical information (e.g.,
diagnosis, treatments, allergies, signs or symptoms) to reference information
routinely used in clinical practice (e.g., practice guidelines) to facilitate
assessments of specific patients. For example, a software function that uses a
patient’s diagnosis and other medical information to provide an HCP with
current practice treatment guidelines for common illnesses or conditions such
as influenza, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.^53
o The software function matches patient-specific medical information to peer-
reviewed literature publications on related topics and enables the health care
professional to independently review the basis for the information.
```
```
o Drug-drug interaction and drug-allergy contraindication notifications to avert
adverse drug reactions. These software functions that identify drug-drug
interactions and drug-allergy contraindications, based on the current version
of FDA-approved drug or device labeling or other up-to-date and peer-
reviewed sources and patient-specific information, to attempt to prevent
adverse drug reactions, and the software functions enable the health care
professional to independently review the basis for the information. For
example, a software function that identifies drug-disease interactions and
contraindications, such as notifying an HCP that a patient with asthma should
not be prescribed a non-selective beta-blocking drug.^54
```
12. **Software functions that provide patients with simple tools to organize and**
    **record their health information** – These are software functions that provide patients
    with tools to organize and record health information without providing
    recommendations to alter or change a previously prescribed treatment or therapy.
    Examples include:

(^51) Similar to example 9.a in Section V.A “Examples of Non-Device CDS Software Functions” in the “Clinical
Decision Support Software” Guidance
(^52) Refer to section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act and the “Clinical Decision Support Software” guidance for
information on the criteria relating to this description.
(^53) Similar to example 2 a-b in Section V.A “Examples of Non-Device CDS Software Functions” in the “Clinical
Decision Support Software” Guidance
(^54) Similar to example 4 a-c in Section V.A “Examples of Non-Device CDS Software Functions” in the “Clinical
Decision Support Software” Guidance


```
o Software functions that provide simple tools for patients with specific
conditions or chronic disease (e.g., obesity, anorexia, arthritis, diabetes, heart
disease) to record their events or measurements (e.g., blood pressure
measurements, drug intake times, diet, daily routine, or emotional state) and
share this information with their health care professional as part of a disease-
management plan.
```
13. **Software functions that are specifically marketed to help patients document,**
    **show, or communicate to health care professionals regarding potential medical**
    **conditions** – These products either pose little or no risk, or are the sole responsibility
    of the health care professionals who have used them in medical applications.
    Examples include:

```
o Software that serves as a videoconferencing portal specifically intended for
medical use and to enhance communications between patients, health care
professionals, and caregivers.
```
14. Software functions that help asthmatics record (i.e., collect and log) inhaler usage,
    asthma episodes experienced, location of user at the time of an attack, or
    environmental triggers of asthma attacks.
15. Software functions that record the clinical conversation a clinician has with a patient
    and sends it (or a link) to the patient to access after the visit.
16. **Software functions that meet the definition of Non-Device-MDDS** –^55 These are
    software functions that are solely intended to transfer, store, convert formats, and
    display medical device data or results, without controlling or altering the functions or
    parameters of any connected medical devices. These do not include software
    functions intended to generate alarms or alerts or prioritize patient-related information
    on multi-patient displays, which are typically used for active patient monitoring to
    enable immediate awareness for potential clinical intervention, and are considered
    device software functions because these functions involve analysis or interpretation of
    laboratory test or other device data and results.
17. **Software functions that display patient-specific medical device data –** These
    include software functions that display medical images directly from a Picture
    Archiving and Communication System (PACS) server;
18. **Software functions that are intended for transferring, storing, converting**
    **formats, or displaying** clinical laboratory test or other device data and results,

(^55) Non-Device-MDDS is considered to be software functions that are solely intended to transfer, store, convert
formats, and display medical device data or results, in accordance with the Medical Device Data Systems,
Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices guidance, available at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-data-systems-
medical-image-storage-devices-and-medical-image-communications-devices.


findings by a health care professional with respect to such data and results, general
information about such findings, and general background information about such
laboratory test or other device, unless such function is intended to interpret or analyze
clinical laboratory test or other device data, results and findings. Examples include:

```
o Software functions that transfer, store, convert formats, and display medical
device data without modifying the data and do not control or alter the
functions or parameters of any connected medical devices (i.e., software
functions that meet the definition of Non-Device-MDDS);
o Software functions that meet the definition of Non-Device-MDDS and
connect to a nursing central station and display (but do not analyze or
interpret) medical device data to a physician’s mobile platform for review;
o Software functions that are not intended for diagnostic image review such as
image display for multidisciplinary patient management meetings (e.g.,
rounds) or patient consultation (and include a persistent on-screen notice,
such as “for informational purposes only and not intended for diagnostic
use”).
```

## Appendix B  Examples of Software Functions for which 

## FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion

This Appendix provides examples of software functions that **MAY** meet the definition of
medical device but for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion. These
software functions may be intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or
in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Even though this software **MAY**
meet the definition of medical device, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for
these types of software functions because they pose lower risk to the public. FDA
understands that there may be other unique and innovative software functions that may not be
covered in this list that may also constitute health care related software. **This list is not
exhaustive** ; it is only intended to provide clarity and assistance in identifying the software
functions that will not be subject to regulatory requirements at this time.

1. Software functions that help patients with diagnosed psychiatric conditions (e.g.,
    post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive
    disorder (OCD)) maintain their behavioral coping skills by providing a “Skill of the
    Day” behavioral technique or audio messages that the user can access when
    experiencing increased anxiety.
2. Software functions that provide periodic educational information, reminders, or
    motivational guidance to pregnant people, smokers trying to quit, or people
    recovering from addiction.
3. Software functions that use global positioning system (GPS) location information to
    alert asthmatics of environmental conditions that may cause asthma symptoms or
    alert an addiction patient (substance abusers) when near a pre-identified, high-risk
    location.
4. Software functions that use video and video games to motivate patients to do their
    physical therapy exercises at home.
5. Software functions that prompt a user to enter which herb and drug they would like to
    take concurrently and provide information about whether interactions have been seen
    in the literature and a summary of what type of interaction was reported.
6. Software functions that use patient characteristics such as age, sex, and behavioral
    risk factors to provide patient-specific screening, counseling, and preventive
    recommendations from well-known and established authorities.
7. Software functions that use a checklist of common signs and symptoms to provide a
    list of possible medical conditions and advice on when to consult a health care
    professional.


8. Software functions that guide a user through a questionnaire of signs and symptoms to
    provide a recommendation for the type of health care facility most appropriate to their
    needs.
9. Software functions that are intended to allow a user to initiate a pre-specified nurse
    call or emergency call using broadband or cellular phone technology.

10.Software functions that enable a patient or caregiver to create and send an alert or
general emergency notification to first responders.

11.Software functions that keep track of medications and provide user-configured
reminders for improved medication adherence.

12.Software functions that provide historical trending and comparison of vital signs (e.g.,
body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory rate).;

13.Software functions that aggregate and display trends in personal health incidents (e.g.,
hospitalization rates or alert notification rates).

14.Software functions allow a user to collect (electronically or manually entered) blood
pressure data and share this data through email, track and trend it, or upload it to a
personal or electronic health record.

15.Software functions that provide oral health reminders or tracking tools fo r users with
gum disease.

16.Software functions that provide prediabetes patients with guidance or tools to help
them develop better eating habits or increase physical activity.

17.Software functions that display, at opportune times, images or other messages for a
substance abuser who wants to stop addictive behavior.

18.Software functions that provide patients and/or caregivers information about drug-
drug interactions and relevant safety information (side effects, drug interactions,
active ingredient) as a report based on demographic data (e.g., age, sex), clinical
information (current diag nosis), and current medications.


## Appendix C  Examples of Software Functions that are the 

## focus of FDA’s regulatory oversight (Device Software 

## Functions and Mobile Medical Apps)

This Appendix provides examples of software functions that are considered medical devices
(i.e., device software functions), and on which FDA will focus its regulatory oversight. This
software meets the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act and its
functionality poses a risk to a patient’s safety if the software were to not function as intended.
Each example below provides a non-exhaustive list of possible relevant product code(s)
and/or regulation number.

FDA also encourages device software manufacturers to search FDA’s public databases, such
as the “Product Classification”^56 database and the “510(k) Premarket Notification”^57
database, to determine the level of regulation for a given device and for the most up-to-date
information about the relevant regulatory requirements.

## Appendix D Brief description of certain device regulatory 

## requirements

This Appendix provides a high level description of certain regulatory requirements for
medical devices, including device software functions. FDA has additional resources and
publications online that describe these and other requirements in detail.

**1. Establishment Registration and Medical Device Listing**

Under 21 CFR Part 807, manufacturers of medical devices are required to annually register
their establishments^62 with FDA and provide a list of the devices they market. The
registration and listing requirement is a means of keeping FDA advised of who is
manufacturing devices, and of the types of devices an establishment is manufacturing.
Medical device manufacturers are required to register their establishments with FDA and to
list^63 by identifying to FDA the devices they are marketing.

Additional information can be found in “Device Advice: Device Registration and Listing.”^64

Industry.Biologics@fda.hhs.gov; phone: 240- 402 - 8020 or 800- 835 - 4709.

**2. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) requirements**

Conducting clinical studies in accordance with the IDE requirements (21 CFR 812)^65 helps to
ensure clinical data are credible, accurate, and ethically procured. Furthermore, an IDE
allows an investigational device to be used in a clinical study, for example in order to collect
safety and effectiveness data required to support^66 a marketing submission to FDA (e.g.,
Premarket Approval (PMA), Premarket Notification (510(k)), De Novo, Humanitarian
Device Exemption (HDE)). Clinical studies with devices of significant risk must be approved

(^62) Under 21 CFR 807.3(c), “Establishment” is defined as “a place of business under one management at one
general physical location at which a device is manufactured, assembled, or otherwise processed.”

you to refer to the guidance “Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and
Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-
fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-
frequently-asked


by FDA and by an Institutional Review Board^67 (IRB) before the study can begin. Studies
with devices of non-significant risk must be approved by the IRB only before the study can
begin.

Medical device manufacturers who intend to conduct research involving human subjects are
encouraged to engage with FDA through the Q-submission Program^68 to receive feedback on
testing and development activities.

Further information regarding the investigational device exemption and Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) can be found in the webpage, “Device Advice: Investigational Device
Exemption.”^69

**3. Labeling requirements**

Medical device manufacturers are required to comply with applicable labeling regulations
found in 21 CFR Part 801 for medical devices and 21 CFR Part 809 for in vitro diagnostic
products.

**4. Premarket submission for approval or clearance**

Medical device manufacturers should identify the current classification covering their device.
Manufacturers are required to prepare and submit to FDA an appropriate premarket
submission, as required for their device classification.

Additional information can be found in “Device Advice: Device Registration and Listing.”^70

**5. Quality System Regulation (QS Regulation)**

Medical device manufacturers are required to comply with the QS regulation.^71 The QS
regulation does not prescribe in detail how a manufacturer must produce a specific device,
but provides a framework for all manufacturers to develop and follow to help ensure that
their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. As part of this
framework, manufacturers are required to develop requirements for their products that will
result in devices that are safe and effective, and to establish methods and procedures to
design, produce, and distribute their devices.

(^67) An IRB must comply with all applicable requirements of the IRB regulation (Part 56) and the IDE regulations
(Part 812) in reviewing and approving device investigations involving human testing. Additional IRB
information can be found on the following FDA webpage: https://www.fda.gov/medical-
devices/investigational-device-exemption-ide/ide-institutional-review-boards-irb

and-listing.
(^71) Available at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part- 820


Furthermore, manufacturers are required, as part of the QS regulation (21 CFR 820.30), to
appropriately verify and validate their device software functions along with the computing
platform to ensure safe and effective operation of the device.

Manufacturers are required to ensure that adequate controls and processes are in place
through purchasing controls to ensure safe distribution, installation, and operation of the
device software function.

Additional information regarding the QS regulation can be found at “Quality System (QS)
Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices.”^72

**6. Medical Device Reporting (MDR) (Adverse event reporting)**

The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation requires manufacturers and importers of
medical devices to submit reports to FDA whenever they receive or otherwise become aware
of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device they market may have
caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a
similar device that they market would be likely to cause or contribute to a reportable death or
serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.^73 MDR requires medical device
manufacturers to:

```
· Submit MDR reportable events involving their medical devices as described in 21
CFR 803.10(c) and 803.50;
· Submit 5-day reports as described in 21 CFR 803.53;
· Submit supplemental reports as described in 21 CFR 803.56;
· Develop, maintain, and implement written procedures for the identification and
evaluation of all medical device events to determine whether the event is MDR
reportable as described in 21 CFR 803.17;
· Conduct an investigation of each event and evaluate the cause of the event as
described in 21 CFR 803.50(b)(3); and
· Establish and maintain complete files for all complaints concerning adverse medical
device events as described in 21 CFR 803.18.
```
The MDR report (FDA Form 3500A)^74 must contain all the information described in 21 CFR
803.52 that is reasonably known to the manufacturer. Information reasonably known includes
any information that:

```
· Can be obtained by contacting a user facility, importer, or other initial reporter;
· Is in the possession of the manufacturer; or

```
**7. Correcting Problems**

A medical device manufacturer may voluntarily take action at any time or may be requested
to take action by FDA to correct problems. Voluntary action is usually taken by device
manufacturers. Examples of the types of actions that a device manufacturer may be requested
to take include, but are not limited to:

```
· Inspecting the device for problems;
· Repairing the device;
· Adjusting settings on the device; and
· Upgrading software to reduce risk from a “bug” or unintended response.
```
Under certain circumstances, FDA may initiate a request that a manufacturer address a
problem with a device through other means, including by removal of the product from the
market. When recommending corrective action, FDA intends to take into account the
essential role that certain device software functions take as an integral part of a larger patient
care system.

**Reporting Corrections to FDA:**

In accordance with 21 CFR 806.10, medical device manufacturers are required to promptly
report, within 10 working days from the time the correction is initiated, to FDA certain
actions concerning device corrections and removals. Specifically, medical device
manufacturers are required to report to FDA any corrections made to a device to reduce a risk
to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act caused by the device
that may present a risk to health.

(^75) Available at https://www.fda.gov/safety/forms-reporting-fda/instructions-completing-form-fda- 3500.
(^76) Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-
reporting-manufacturers.


The reporting requirement does not extend to all modifications to devices. For example,
certain actions that would improve the quality of a mobile medical app but that would not
reduce a risk to health posed by the mobile medical app or remedy a violation of the FD&C
Act are not required to be reported under 21 CFR 806.1(b).^77 If there is not a “risk to health”
involved, a report to FDA is not required, but the device manufacturer must keep a record of
the correction. An example of such action taken by the manufacturer could be changes made
to correct a defect that creates a nuisance for the user but does not present a risk to the health
of the user or patient.

More information about reporting requirements under 21 CFR Part 806 is available in
“Device Advice: Recalls, Corrections, and Removals.”^78

(^77) Under 21 CFR 806.1(b), the following actions are exempt from the reporting requirements of Part 806:
(1) Actions taken by device manufacturers or importers to improve the performance or quality of a device but
that do not reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the act caused by the device.
(2) Market withdrawals as defined in 21 CFR 806.2(i).
(3) Routine servicing as defined in 21 CFR 806.2(l).
(4) Stock recoveries as defined in 21 CFR 806.2(m).

## Appendix E Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

```
1) I have a software function that is not identified in this guidance. What is the best
way to get additional information from FDA about my product?
```
**Answer** : FDA recognizes that this guidance does not describe all types of software used in
health care. Some manufacturers may be unsure whether their software function is
considered a medical device that is subject to regulatory oversight, or whether their medical
device could be under FDA’s intent to exercise enforcement discretion. If the device is
subject to regulatory oversight, manufacturers may have questions about which regulatory
requirements are applicable to their software function.

After reviewing this guidance, FDA encourages software manufacturers to contact the
Agency to obtain more information using one of the following ways:

- Phone or email – For information about regulatory requirements, contact the Division of
    Industry and Consumer Education (DICE). Email: DICE@fda.hhs.gov; phone: 301- 796 -
    7100 or 800- 638 - 2041.

```
For information about whether your software or mobile app is considered a medical
device, contact digitalhealth@fda.hhs.gov.
```
```
If your question relates to apps used in blood establishments or another area of CBER
regulation, contact the Office of Communication, Outreach and Development, Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research; email: ocod@fda.hhs.gov; phone: 1- 800 - 835 - 4709 or
240 - 402 - 7800.
```
- Online – FDA has several resources and publications online that describe various
    regulatory requirements in detail. FDA’s “Device Advice”^79 website and online courses
    at “CDRH Learn”^80 are a good place to start. Other sections in this guidance provide links
    to more detailed information related to more specific topics.
- Letter – For written feedback about the classification and the regulatory requirements that
    may be applicable to a device software function, manufacturers should use the 513(g)
    process. Specifically, a manufacturer should submit the following for a 513(g)
    submission:

```
· User fee;
· Cover letter;
· Description of the software;
· Description of what the software is to be used for; and
```
(^79) Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance.
(^80) Available at https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn.


```
· Any proposed labeling or promotional material for the software and, as
applicable, any labeling or promotional material of a similar, legally marketed
device, if available.
```
FDA will generally issue a response to the 513(g), in the form of a confidential letter to the
manufacturer, within 60 days of receipt of the request for information. For more specific
information about what to include in a 513(g) and where to send it, refer to FDA’s guidance
“FDA and Industry Procedures for Section 513(g) Requests for Information Contains
Nonbinding Recommendations Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.”^81 For
more information about 513(g) user fees, refer to FDA’s guidance “User Fees for 513(g)
Requests for Information”^82

```
2) Why does FDA recommend that manufacturers follow the Quality System (QS)
regulation for those software that MAY be devices and could be device software
functions but for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion?
```
**Answer** : FDA believes all manufacturers of medical device software should have in place an
adequate quality management system that helps ensure that their products consistently meet
applicable requirements and specifications and can support the software throughout its total
life cycle. Adequate quality management systems incorporate appropriate risk management
strategies, good design practices, adequate verification and validation, and appropriate
methods to correct and prevent risks to patients and adverse events that may arise from the
use of the product. All of these elements are part of FDA’s QS regulation.

```
3) Is FDA’s QS regulation similar to software development practices I already use?
```
**Answer:** Most likely. Though not all of the principles in the QS regulation are applicable to
the development and manufacture of quality device software functions,^83 the majority of
them are applicable and are consistent with commonly used and accepted good software
development practices, such as those from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers’ (IEEE), Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), and Carnegie
Mellon Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
methods.

FDA’s approach to QS regulation is also harmonized with certain international standards
such as ISO 9001 and ISO 13485.^84 Similar to these international standards, the QS
regulation does not prescribe in detail how a manufacturer must produce a specific device,
but provides a framework for all manufacturers to develop and follow to help ensure that

their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. The QS
regulation can apply to and be scaled for any size manufacturer and any type of product. It
also allows for a manufacturer to choose those requirements most appropriate for its given
device and manufacturing process.^85

```
4) What are some examples of parts of the QS regulation that are of particular
importance to device software functions and where can I find more information
about them?
```
**Answer:** Though not a complete list, some examples of principles within the QS regulation
that are relevant to all device manufacturers include risk assessment and management, design
controls, and corrective and preventive actions. Risk assessment and management is a critical
part of good quality management systems. Good design practices are important to the
development and manufacture of safe medical devices. It is also important for manufacturers
to have procedures in place to identify, analyze, correct, and prevent software-related causes
of patient or user harm. References related to these examples are provided in Appendix D of
this guidance. Additional references about these principles that manufacturers may find
useful include FDA’s guidances on “Design Control Guidance for Medical Device
Manufacturers,”^86 and “General Principles of Software Validation.”^87

```
5) Do all the device software function manufacturers have to submit a premarket
submission and receive FDA clearance or approval before marketing?
```
**Answer** : No, not all manufacturers have to submit a premarket submission (i.e., a 510(k) or
PMA) prior to marketing their device software function. This determination depends on the
classification of the device. Manufacturers of devices that are exempt from 510(k) or PMA
requirements do not have to file a submission with FDA prior to marketing their device. For
example, the majority of class I devices are exempt from the premarket submission
requirements and are subject to the least regulatory control.

Regardless of whether medical devices are subject to the premarket submission requirements,
most medical devices (including Class I devices) have to comply with other basic regulatory
requirements that are called “General Controls.” More information about what “General
Controls” are and what a medical device manufacturer should do to comply with these
requirements, can be found in “Device Advice: General Controls for Medical Devices”^88 and
“Regulatory Controls.”^89

(^85) See 21 CFR 820.1 (stating “if a manufacturer engages in only some operations subject to the requirements in
this part, and not in others, that manufacturer need only comply with those requirements applicable to the
operations in which it is engaged.”).

6) Some FDA classifications state they are “510(k) exempt.” What does 510(k)
exempt mean and how do I know if it applies to my product?
```
**Answer** : If a classification states the device type is “510(k) exempt,” this means that the
manufacturer is not required to submit a premarket notification (i.e., a 510(k)) prior to
marketing the device. However, the 510(k) exemption may be subject to certain limitations.
Manufacturers are encouraged to confirm the device’s exempt status and any limitations to
that status that may apply in accordance with 21 CFR Parts 862 – 892. The webpage
“Medical Device Exemptions 510(k) and GMP Requirements” contains additional
information about 510(k) exempt devices.^90

```
7) If a 510(k) is required for my device software function, what type of software
documentation does FDA recommend I include in the submission?
```
**Answer** : FDA’s recommendations for the software-related documentation that you provide
in your premarket submission are addressed in detail in FDA’s “Guidance for the Content of
Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices.”^91

If the device software function uses off-the-shelf software, manufacturers should also refer to
FDA’s “Guidance for Industry, FDA Reviewers, and Compliance on Off-the-Shelf Software
Use in Medical Devices.”^92

```
8) I am a medical device manufacturer and making my product labeling available
electronically using a mobile app. Is my app considered a mobile medical app?
```
**Answer** : Mobile apps that provide electronic access and are intended for use as a digital
version of medical device labeling or instructions for use are not considered a medical device
on their own and therefore are not considered mobile medical apps. These are apps from a
device manufacturer that provide information to support the company’s own device.
Examples include apps that provide an electronic copy of cleared or approved medical device
labeling or apps that provide video instruction for how to use a medical device. These types
of apps are not considered devices within themselves, but instead are considered part of the
medical device labeling and are subject to the regulatory labeling requirements relevant to
that particular product.

```
9) Is an electronic method of collecting clinical investigations, for example through
a mobile app, considered a device software function, and if so, what
requirements apply?
```
**Answer** : Software used for data collection in clinical studies (such as electronic Patient
Reported Outcomes (ePRO) apps) is not considered on its own to be a device software

function. However, manufacturers and users of this type of software should see FDA’s
guidance related to use of computers in clinical trials, “Electronic Source Data in Clinical
Investigations,”^93 issued on September 17, 2013.

```
10) I am a medical device manufacturer. Is an electronic method of collecting and
storing quality systems information in my manufacturing process considered a
medical device?
```
**Answer** : Software used in the production process for medical devices, or for collecting,
storing and maintaining quality system data collection for medical devices (including
complaint submissions) is not considered a medical device on its own. This software does not
meet the definition of medical device, but is part of the quality system. However this
software is required to comply with the appropriate good manufacturing practices (GMP)
regulations.^94
